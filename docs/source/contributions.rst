=============

The future of privacy in Ethereum also depends on you! The design space of privacy-enhanced broadcast and routing algorithms is enormous. Can you design a more private broadcast or message routing algorithm? Do you have an adversarial strategy that can deanonymize message originators better than what is already added to the simulator? Then, feel free to contribute to our simulator! We intend this endeavor to develop into a community effort towards a more private Ethereum. 

We encourage the community to contribute to this simulator by proposing their privacy-enhanced message routing protocols. Feel free to open a PR or create an issue at `our GitHub repository <https://github.com/ferencberes/ethp2psim>`_.
